# Overview
This project is a REST API application with a frontend, created to showcase my understanding of REST APIs and their implementation. The focus is on designing a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture while adhering to best practices in software development.

## Features
The REST API incorporates the following:

- **Serilog:** A robust logging library for detailed diagnostics and tracking.

- **MediatR:** Facilitates structured communication between components to enhance modularity.

- **CQRS:** Ensures separation of concerns by implementing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern.

- **Clean Architecture:** Provides a clear and organized project structure for scalability and maintainability.

- **SOLID Principles:** Promotes best practices in object-oriented programming to achieve flexibility and reusability.
